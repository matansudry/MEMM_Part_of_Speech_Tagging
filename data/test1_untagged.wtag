About 400,000 commuters trying to find their way through the Bay area 's quake-torn transportation system wedged cheek-to-jowl into subways , sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday .
In other words , it was a better-than-average Manhattan commute .
City officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last Tuesday 's earthquake .
The massive temblor , which killed at least 61 people , severed the Bay Bridge , a major artery to the east , and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101 , the biggest artery to the south .
It will take several weeks to repair the bridge , and several months to repair some of the 101 connections .
But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm , gridlock never materialized , mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50 % more passengers than normal .
For the first time in memory , it was standing-room only in BART 's sleek , modern railcars .
Moreover , the two main bridges still connecting San Francisco with the East Bay did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping .
Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours , or that many workers are still staying at home .
Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge , which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span , actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday , provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations .
In the best of times , the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region , often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more .
Not that getting into town was easy .
Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway , and many commuters had to find rides to BART 's stations , because parking lots were full before dawn .
Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray , stranding commuters such as Marilyn Sullivan .
Her commute from Petaluma , Calif. , normally takes an hour and 15 minutes , via the Golden Gate Bridge , which connects San Francisco with the North Bay area .
Yesterday , she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours , trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district .
`` It 's worse than I thought , '' she said .
`` I do n't know where all the buses are . ''
But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate , by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out .
`` It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had , '' said Charles Catania , an insurance broker on the bus from Mill Valley in Marin County .
`` It looks like a holiday .
I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . ''
However , a spokeswoman for BankAmerica Corp. said yesterday 's absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day .
At the San Mateo Bridge , which connects the San Francisco peninsula with the East Bay , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved .
`` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated , '' said Stan Perez , a sergeant with the California Highway Patrol .
There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role .
The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday , but over four hours rather than the usual two-hour crush .
Bechtel Group Inc. , the giant closely held engineering concern , says it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work .
Of Bechtel 's 17,500 employees , about 4,000 work in San Francisco -- one-third of them commuting from stricken East Bay .
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is offering its 6,000 San Francisco employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
The flextime may cut by almost a third the number of PG&E employees working conventional 9-5 hours , a spokesman says .
Some of the utility 's employees may opt for a four-day workweek , 10 hours a day , to cut the commute by 20 % .
At Pacific Telesis Group , flextime is left up to individual working groups , because some of the telephone company 's employees must be on-site during normal business hours , a spokeswoman says .
Some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock .
One senior vice president at Bechtel said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into San Francisco from the East Bay .
But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last .
Although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate .
And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .
Garry Kasparov went to combat Sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can .
Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position .
Then he unleashed his own , unstoppable , attack .
And in the second game , with Mr. Kasparov advancing ferociously as white , D.T. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster .
Well , mankind can rest easier for now .
Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26-year-old Soviet to beat the Pennsylvania-based computer , he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected .
And when Mr. Kasparov strode into the playing hall , he called the outcome .
As if he were Iron Mike , about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling , he declared : `` I 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years . ''
His strategy against D.T. was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games , he said , including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S. .
Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed .
`` The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he said .
The champion apparently was not worried at all about D.T. 's strong points .
Its chief builder , Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu , nicknamed his brainchild `` the Weasel '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions .
D.T. also has a prodigious and flawless memory , is utterly fearless , and could n't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall , in the New York Academy of Art .
In fact , D.T. never left home , Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link .
They conceded that the odds favored Mr. Kasparov , but they put their hope in D.T. 's recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second , from 720,000 .
But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed kryptonite .
This became apparent as game one , a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov , proceeded .
No human can examine millions of moves , but Mr. Kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones .
After eight moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980 .
But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly .
Instead of castling , a standard measure to safeguard the king , D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13 ; then it put a knight offside on move 16 .
`` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said Edmar Mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans .
By move 21 , D.T. had fallen into a deep positional trap .
It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T. 's knights .
Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights , but in this case Mr. Kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and D.T. 's surviving bishop was reduced to passivity .
Indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a `` tall pawn , '' as spectators snidely put it .
Consistently , D.T. was over-optimistic about its chances , which it continually sized up , in numerical form .
When most spectators thought its position hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , one-half of a pawn down .
Such evaluations met with derision , and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have -- prompting more derision .
While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost .
He also launched a kingside storm , sacrificing a pawn to denude D.T. 's king .
No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T .
A piece down , the computer resigned .
Now , with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood , the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two .
With the advantage of playing white -LRB- which moves first -RRB- , Mr. Kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer 's defense , a Queen 's Gambit Accepted .
As early as move six , Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight .
This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn , to the neglect of kingside development .
`` In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' Mr. Kasparov said later .
In such positions , he explained , `` you have to create something new , and the computer is n't able to do that right now . ''
After only 11 moves for each side , the computer 's position was shaky .
Greedily , it grabbed a pawn , at the cost of facing a brutal attack .
And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats .
Mr. Kasparov remarked later that `` even a weak club player '' would have avoided the queen move .
Now , after only a dozen moves , spectators were looking for a mating combination .
On a demonstration board , emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator refuted this line of play .
Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .
He won D.T. 's queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation , in this position , to give the computer much hope .
In a hopeless position , the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move .
And Mr. Kasparov , to cheers and applause , marched back into the analysis room .
`` In both games I got exactly what I wanted , '' he said .
What he had demonstrated , he added , is that there 's more to chess than sheer calculation .
Undeterred , D.T. 's handlers vowed to press on .
Indeed , three of them will be building a successor machine for International Business Machines Corp .
Promises Feng-hsiung Hsu : `` In three years we 'll mount a better challenge . ''
Mr. Tannenbaum is a reporter in the Journal 's New York bureau .
Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in .
Just ask Richard Blumenfeld , a New Jersey dentist who considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated investor . ''
In May 1986 , Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 % .
`` It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly , '' Dr. Blumenfeld recalls .
Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 % .
The CD seemed like a great deal .
But nearly 3 1\/2 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 .
The problem is that the CD he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain vanilla CD .
Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value .
The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return .
More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .
Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value .
Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance .
The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month .
Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured .
`` This is one thing I was never aware of , '' he says .
He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $ 100,000 , '' he adds .
Dr. Blumenfeld is n't unique .
Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect , too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk .
`` Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things , '' says John Markese , research director of the American Association of Individual Investors , a Chicago-based educational group .
`` The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . ''
Dr. Blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying .
He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs -LRB- Treasury Income Growth Receipts -RRB- , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch .
But he says he did n't understand he was buying the CD on the secondary market , and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks .
The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York .
Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a `` fact sheet '' sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale .
The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured ... .
Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant . ''
Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .
`` I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD , '' he says .
Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid .
-LRB- Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation , to a maximum of $ 100,000 . -RRB-
`` It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , '' says Albert Disposti , a managing director of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc .
`` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks .
`` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . ''
Merrill Lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years .
Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 .
Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $ 1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding , and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total .
Merrill Lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs .
Still , there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding .
Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education .
Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years , and they usually double in value by maturity .
But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured .
People who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed .
However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid .
Whatever the case , a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate .
Dr. Blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved .
And he says he 's learned a lesson : `` You always have to watch out for yourself .
No one else will watch out for you .
Americans are drinking less , but young professionals from Australia to West Germany are rushing to buy premium-brand American vodka , brandy and other spirits .
In particular , many are snubbing the scotch preferred by their parents and opting for bourbon , the sweet firewater from the Kentucky countryside .
With U.S. liquor consumption declining steadily , many American producers are stepping up their marketing efforts abroad .
And those efforts are paying off : Spirits exports jumped more than 2 1\/2 times to $ 157.2 million in 1988 from $ 59.8 million in 1983 , according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. , a trade group .
`` Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers , '' says Michael Bellas , president of Beverage Marketing Corp. , a research and consulting firm .
`` If you want to be a player , you have to be in America , Europe and the Far East .
You must have world-class brands , a long-term perspective and deep pockets . ''
The internationalization of the industry has been hastened by foreign companies ' acquisitions of many U.S. producers .
In recent years , for example , Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain acquired Heublein Inc. , while another British company , Guinness PLC , took over United Distillers Group and Schenley Industries Inc .
But the shift has also been fueled by necessity .
While premium-brand spirits like Smirnoff vodka and Jack Daniel 's whiskey are riding high in the U.S. , domestic spirits consumption fell 15 % to 141.1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979 .
In recent years , growth has come in the foreign markets .
U.S. brandy exports more than doubled last year to 360,000 proof gallons , a standard industry measure , according to Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group , an industry association .
Exports of rum surged 54 % to 814,000 proof gallons .
Mexico is the biggest importer of both rum and brandy from the U.S. .
Japan , the world 's third-largest liquor market after the U.S. and Britain , helped American companies in April when it lowered its tax on imported spirits and levied a tax on many domestic products .
California wineries , benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies , are expanding aggressively into Japan , as well as Canada and Great Britain .
In Japan , the wineries are promoting their products ' Pacific roots and courting restaurant and hotel chefs , whose recommendations carry weight .
In Australia , Britain , Canada and Greece , Brown-Forman Corp. has increased its marketing of Southern Comfort Liqueur .
Using cinema , television and print ads , the company pitches Southern Comfort as a grand old drink of the antebellum American South .
The biggest foreign inroads , though , have been made by bourbon .
While U.S. makers of vodka , rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad , trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon .
-LRB- All bourbon comes from Kentucky , though Jack Daniel 's Tennessee whiskey often is counted as bourbon because of similarity of taste . -RRB-
Moreover , just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the U.S. , bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries , a uniquely American product tied to frontier folklore .
How was the West won ?
With a six-shooter in one hand and bourbon in the other .
`` We imagine with bourbon the Wild West , Western motion pictures and gunmen appearing , '' says Kenji Kishimoto , vice president of Suntory International Corp. , a division of Suntory Ltd. , Japan 's largest liquor company .
Suntory distributes Brown-Forman bourbons in Japan .
Bourbon makes up just 1 % of world-wide spirits consumption , but it represented 57 % of U.S. liquor exports last year , according to Jobson ; no other category had more than 19 % .
Big U.S. distillers are fiercely vying for this market , which grew to $ 77 million last year from $ 33 million in 1987 , according to government figures .
Jim Beam Brands Co. , a division of American Brands Inc. , is the leading exporter of bourbon and produces 10 other types of liquor .
The company says it will increase its international advertising 35 % in 1990 , with bourbon representing most of that amount .
Guinness 's Schenley Industries unit has increased its TV advertising in Japan and has built partnerships with duty-free shops throughout Asia , enabling it to install prominent counter displays .
The company 's I.W. Harper brand is the leading bourbon in Japan , with 40 % of the market .
Bourbon exporters have succeeded in Japan where other industries have failed , avoiding cultural hitches in marketing and distribution by allying themselves with local agents .
Jim Beam Brands has a distribution partnership with Nikka Whiskey Co. , a distiller .
Seagram Co. , which exports Four Roses bourbon , has such a link with Kirin Brewery Co .
Some bourbon makers advertise abroad as they do at home .
To promote Jack Daniel 's overseas , Brown-Forman uses the same photos of front porches from Lynchburg , Va. , and avuncular old men in overalls and hightops .
Jim Beam print ads , however , strike different chords in different countries .
In Australia , land of the outback , a snapshot of Jim Beam lies on a strip of hand-tooled leather .
West Germans get glitz , with bourbon in the foreground and a posh Beverly Hills hotel in the background .

Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. 's net income rose 29 % on a modest 9 % increase in revenue in the third quarter , mainly on strong advertising demand at its ABC television network operation .
Demand for ads also rose at the eight TV stations Capital Cities owns and at its 80%-owned ESPN sports cable channel .
The broadcast and publishing company reported net climbed to $ 80.8 million , or $ 4.56 a share , from $ 62.6 million , or $ 3.55 a share , in the year-earlier period .
Revenue reached $ 1.1 billion from $ 1.01 billion .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Capital Cities closed at $ 558.50 , down $ 5 .
The broadcasting unit reported operating profit of $ 134.9 million , up 18 % from the year-earlier $ 114.3 million .
Publishing reported operating profit was $ 33.3 million , nearly flat with the year-before $ 33 million .
Revenue at the broadcasting unit , consisting of the network and stations , advanced 11 % , to $ 838 million from $ 752.9 million .
The publishing unit reported revenue edged up 2.6 % to $ 263.2 million from $ 256.6 million .
Chairman Thomas S. Murphy cited Capital Cities ' nine daily newspapers in explaining most of the gain .
The parent also publishes weeklies , shopping guides and specialty magazines .
For 1989 's first nine months , Capital Cities net income grew 23 % to $ 303.7 million , or $ 16.97 a share , from $ 246.9 million , or $ 14.43 a share .
Revenue eased 0.3 % to $ 3.45 billion from $ 3.46 billion .

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp called on the Federal Reserve System to lower interest rates .
In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association , Mr. Kemp broke the administration 's public silence on the Fed and complained that `` interest rates are too high . ''
`` I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4 % or 5 % would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts , the housing stock , our industry in America , the refurbishing of our industrial system , it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit , '' Mr. Kemp said .
The Fed recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to 8 3\/4 % from about 9 % .
Bush administration officials say inflation is under control .
With economic growth slowing , they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further .
But for the most part , officials have avoided expressing those views in public , fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed .
McDonald 's Corp. said third-quarter earnings rose 14 % on a hefty sales gain , but domestic franchisees apparently did n't partake of the improvement .
The world 's largest fast-food chain said net income rose to $ 217.9 million , or 59 cents a share , from $ 191.3 million , or 51 cents a share , a year ago .
In the latest period , the company had an average of 370.8 million shares , 5.6 million shares below last year 's level .
Revenue rose 12 % to $ 1.63 billion from $ 1.46 billion .
Systemwide sales , which include sales at franchisee as well as company-owned stores , totaled $ 4.59 billion compared with $ 4.2 billion .
But sales for U.S. franchisees were flat at best on a per-store basis despite weak 1988 figures .
Compared with the first nine months of last year , average franchisee store sales this year were down nearly $ 3,200 , reflecting a fierce discounting war among fast-food chains .
Since McDonald 's menu prices rose this year , the actual decline may have been more .
McDonald 's closed at $ 31.375 , up $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
While franchisees were having a tough time holding sales , McDonald 's company-operated stores posted hefty gains for the nine months , with sales per company-operated unit rising $ 20,000 .
One analyst noted that the company often has better store locations than do its franchisees , thus aiding promotional efforts .
On average in the latest nine months , company-operated units in the U.S. had $ 90,552 more in sales than did franchised outlets .
There are more than three times as many franchised domestic outlets as there are company stores .
Profit margins at U.S. company-owned stores in the quarter were up nearly 1 % , which the company attributed in part to lower food costs .
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Leslie Steppel said reduced labor costs helped boost margins , although she doubted `` that kind of performance is sustainable . ''
Calling sales `` still relatively soft , '' Ms. Steppel believes that in real terms , U.S. sales slipped 3 1\/2 % to 4 % at company-operated stores in the quarter .
Apparently acknowledging weaker U.S. sales systemwide , McDonald 's vowed `` to use our size and muscle to do all that is necessary to build the brand . ''
Overseas , both franchisees and the company performed substantially better than a year ago .
Third-quarter sales in Europe were exceptionally strong , boosted by promotional programs and new products -- although weaker foreign currencies reduced the company 's earnings .
McDonald 's said that systemwide sales would have been $ 115 million greater had 1988 exchange rates remained in effect .
`` Going into the fourth quarter the sales comparison will be more difficult , '' predicted restaurant analyst Howard Hansen of Kidder , Peabody & Co .
Reflecting better growth prospects abroad , McDonald 's noted that as of Sept. 30 more stores were under construction overseas than a year ago , while the opposite was true for domestic expansion .
At the end of the third quarter McDonald 's had 10,873 units operating world-wide .
In the nine months , earnings rose 12 % to $ 555.6 million , or $ 1.49 a share , from $ 494.4 million , or $ 1.31 a share , a year earlier .
Revenue rose 11 % to $ 4.56 billion from $ 4.12 billion .
Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. 's common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a Finnish shipbuilder would delay delivery of three big cruise ships .
The Miami-based company 's stock fell $ 1.75 yesterday to $ 20.75 a share in heavy American Stock Exchange composite trading .
Early yesterday , Carnival said in a company statement that it had been `` notified unofficially '' that Waertsilae Marine Industries , the Finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships , planned to file for bankruptcy .
Officials at Carnival declined to comment .
`` There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect , if any , of all this is , '' said John P. Uphoff , an analyst at Raymond James Associates Inc .
`` I did n't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy . ''
Carnival said the `` Fantasy , '' the first of the three $ 200 million ships that Carnival has on order , is scheduled to be delivered next month , just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean .
That ship , which would carry about 2,050 passengers , would expand the capacity of Carnival 's existing 14-ship fleet by 24 % .
The second ship , which is half-completed , is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 , and the third in fall 1991 .
`` There 's a 99 % chance that the Fantasy will be delivered close to schedule , '' said Caroline Levy , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
`` The others will probably be delivered as well , but Carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them . ''
She said the company could pay as much as 25 % more for the ships .
If the ships are n't delivered , however , it will likely have an effect on the company 's earnings as soon as the 1990 fiscal year , which begins Dec. 1 .
Analysts said those estimates -- which range from about $ 1.80 a share to $ 1.95 a share -- are based on Fantasy being in operation in 1990 .
If the ship fails to arrive , those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed 15 cents or more .
Analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money Carnival might lose through deposits .
Normally , a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction .
Carnival , for example , has already paid about $ 160 million of the total cost for Fantasy .
Some analysts say this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it .
According to reports from Finland , Waertsilae Marine , 19%-owned by conglomerate Oy Waertsilae , filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard 's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees .
The shipyard disclosed in mid-August that it expected losses stemming from a series of unprofitable orders .
Designer Sandra Garratt filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code protection , saying that her cash flow had been cut off .
The designer , whose line of modular , one-size-fits-all clothing has spawned a host of clones , has been in a dispute with her latest licensee , Jerell Inc. for several months .
Ms. Garratt was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in March .
The designer 's attorney , Molly Bartholow , said that Ms. Garratt was forced to start bankruptcy-law proceedings because Jerell began withholding her royalty payments last month .
Jerell paid Ms. Garratt royalties for the line known as Multiples by Sandra Garratt , which are sold primarily through department stores .
Ms. Garratt sued the Dallas apparel maker earlier this year , charging that Jerell developed and marketed clothing lines fashioned after her designs , in violation of their contract .
That lawsuit is still pending .
Jerell could n't immediately be reached for comment .
Ms. Garratt 's assets and liabilities were n't disclosed .
Eaton Corp. had a 26 % drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts , its largest and most profitable single business .
Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates , leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels , said Stephen R. Hardis , vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer .
He declined to make a specific earnings estimate .
Third-quarter net was $ 40 million , or $ 1.04 a share , from $ 54.4 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year ago .
Sales rose 2.8 % to $ 864.1 million , from $ 840.4 million .
The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales did n't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do , said Patrick E. Sheridan , analyst with McDonald & Co .
Mr. Sheridan , who had been expecting quarter profit of about $ 1.25 a share , says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ 5.70 a share , from his previous estimate of $ 6.10 .
Eli Lustgarten of PaineWebber Inc. , who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $ 5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market , says he will make another cut to about $ 5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report .
He said Eaton 's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated .
Eaton said sales of truck axles , transmissions and other parts fell 7.2 % to $ 295 million .
Sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose .
Eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category , but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell 26 % to $ 51 million on an about 1 % drop in sales to $ 488 million .
Mr. Hardis said truck-fleet operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy behaves .
The truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods , he said , and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral .
Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls , Eaton 's other major business group , fell 11 % to $ 32 million , despite a 7.7 % increase in sales to $ 376 million .
The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market .
For the nine months , net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $ 17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $ 170.6 million , or $ 4.54 a share , up 5.8 % from $ 161.3 million , or $ 4.32 a share , a year ago .
Eaton earned from continuing operations $ 165.1 million , or $ 4.40 a share , down 7 % from $ 177.5 million , or $ 4.76 a share , a year earlier .
Nine-month sales were $ 2.79 billion , up 8.2 % from $ 2.58 billion a year earlier .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Eaton closed at $ 57.50 a share , down $ 2.50 .
In Poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative , environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy , cut cumbersome bureaucracies , and democratize local politics .
Initial steps were taken at Poland 's first international environmental conference , which I attended last month .
The conference , held in Lower Silesia , was co-sponsored by the Environment Ministry , the Rockefeller Brothers Fund , and the Polish Ecological Club , and was attended by 50 Poles from government and industry , as well as Hungarians , Czechs , Russians , Japanese and Americans .
The conference was entitled `` Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection , '' a significant departure from East Bloc usage , which recognizes only one economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior .
Even more remarkably , it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution , notwithstanding Poland 's lack of functioning markets .
Why did East Bloc participants unanimously endorse market-based pollution approaches ?
The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation .
Like other East Bloc countries , Poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance .
According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey Institute , 27 areas containing a third of Poland 's population are regarded as `` ecological hazards '' due to multiple violations of standards .
Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions .
Four-fifths of Poland 's soils have become highly acidified ; 70 % of its southern forests are projected to die by century 's end .
Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled .
Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe .
Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average .
Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP .
Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from -LRB- a -RRB- Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; -LRB- b -RRB- planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and -LRB- c -RRB- the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West .
They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions .
The solutions they formally proposed included lead\/sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
But their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state , making it fully accountable for pollution control .
A revolution takes more than conference manifestos .
Indeed , skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference : `` The world must be coming to an end .
The Russians are talking peace .
The Palestinians are talking elections .
And the Poles are engaged in commerce . ''
But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year .
Those implications include : -- Privatization .
Faced with a $ 40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance .
Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries .
But it could also accelerate `` marketization '' by reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects .
-- Least-cost solutions .
As conferees noted , scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms .
That means simple , clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction , deferring more complex issues such as risk .
It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits , rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees .
That 's because quota-trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals .
-- Creative financing .
Even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars .
New types of financing must make funds available without draining Poland 's hard-currency reserves .
-- Democratization .
East Bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets .
While Polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information .
For once information flows , public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to reimpose .
-- Global reciprocity .
One participant prematurely declared that America has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection , while Poland represents the opposite .
His point : It will be increasingly difficult for the U.S. to cling to command-and-control measures if even the East Bloc steps to a different drummer .
At the moment , Poland resembles 19th-century Pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society -- with antiquated production , inadequate environmental management , and little ecological awareness .
But the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy .
Mr. Levin , former head of EPA 's regulatory reform staff , adapted this from his November column for the Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association .
Disappointing earnings news from some technology companies unnerved investors in the over-the-counter market , who sold shares of Apple Computer , Intel and many other computer-related concerns .
The drop in those and other technology stocks contributed to an 0.7 % slide by the Nasdaq composite index .
It finished at 467.22 , down 3.45 .
The nervousness about the technology stock outlook also hurt the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which slipped about 1 % .
Mostly because of the sell-off in technology stocks , the Nasdaq 100 Index of the OTC 's largest non-financial issues dropped 4.58 to 457.52 .
The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking issues lost 2.38 to 458.32 .
Some traders said the sell-off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by investors .
But Charlie Howley , vice president in charge of OTC trading at SoundView Financial in Stamford , Conn. , said the selling was orderly .
`` It 's a quiet retreat , '' said Mr. Howley .
`` It 's nothing dramatic , just a routine sell-off . ''
Some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies , he said .
But some of it also represented profit-taking by investors who have made big gains in some issues .
Yesterday 's volume of 117.2 million shares was far below last week 's sizzling average of nearly 177 million .
For October so far , daily volume is averaging 150.3 million , putting it on track to be the year 's busiest month .
Apple Computer , which reported lackluster earnings Friday , lost 1 1\/4 to 46 3\/4 on 1.1 million shares .
Stratus Computer , which reported earnings late Friday that were in line with a disappointing forecast , eased 3\/4 to 24 on 816,000 shares .
Investors apparently did n't like the news from Rainbow Technologies either .
It said net income was 17 cents a share in the third quarter , compared with 16 cents a share a year earlier .
Rainbow 's stock dropped 2 to 14 1\/4 .
Other technology stocks that were weaker included Intel , which fell 1 1\/4 to 33 1\/2 on 1.9 million shares , Mentor Graphics , down 3\/4 to 16 1\/4 on 1.6 million shares , Sun Microsystems , which slipped 3\/8 to 18 1\/4 , and MCI Communications , down 1 to 42 3\/4 .
Microsoft , which last week rose to a record , fell victim to profit-taking , traders said , as it declined 2 1\/8 to 83 1\/8 .
Conner Peripherals was unchanged at 15 .
Among takeover stocks , Jefferson Smurfit jumped 1 1\/4 to 42 1\/2 after SIBV-MS Holdings said the price to be paid to Jefferson Smurfit 's minority holders has been raised to $ 43 a share .
The increase of $ 1.25 a share is being made to settle shareholder litigation relating to SIBV-MS 's tender offer .
SIBV-MS Holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of Jefferson Smurfit and a Morgan Stanley limited partnership .
The Jefferson Smurfit affiliate , Smurfit International B.V. , holds about 78 % of the shares outstanding .
These shares will be bought by SIBV-MS Holdings at $ 41.75 each after the acquisition of the minority shares .
Another takeover target , LIN Broadcasting , eased 1\/2 to 110 1\/8 on 313,800 shares .
LIN 's suitor , McCaw Cellular Communications , dropped 1 to 40 on almost 350,000 shares .
Some analysts say investors will begin paying more attention to earnings , partly in response to the latest round of disappointments .
They say investors will favor companies that historically have posted annual earnings growth of 15 % to 20 % .
That would be good news for the OTC market , some analysts say , because many small growth stocks are traded there .
Michael R. Weisberg , partner in charge of research at Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco , said some investors have already made the switch .
The Robertson Stephens Index of 340 emerging growth stocks is up 23.1 % for the year through Friday .
The rise matches that of the Dow Jones industrials this year .
`` It 's been a spectacular year for the emerging growth stock investor , '' Mr. Weisberg said .
He predicted that the most popular growth companies will be those with `` some kind of unique product or franchise '' that makes them appear able to sustain their momentum .
He puts the OTC market 's Nellcor , Office Club and BizMart on the list .
Nellcor , a maker of electronic patient monitoring systems , was up 3\/4 to 16 7\/8 on 258,000 shares yesterday , while retailing issue Office Club was unchanged at 10 3\/4 on 65,200 shares .
BizMart , another retailing stock , was off 3\/8 to 8 1\/4 on nearly 80,000 shares .
Other favorites of growth-stock analysts and money managers also had a mixed session .
Payco American , a credit collection concern , jumped 1 3\/8 to 20 5\/8 on volume of 93,000 , and Mail Boxes Etc. , a private postal services company , advanced 1\/2 to 23 1\/2 on volume of 64,000 .
But Legent , a systems software stock , was down 1\/2 to 29 3\/4 on 39,300 shares .
Novell , a computer networking concern , fell 1 1\/2 to 30 on 152,000 shares .
Elsewhere , Valley National continued its slide , dropping 2 1\/8 to 15 on 1.7 million shares .
The Arizona banking concern is facing difficulties related to weakness in the real estate market in the state .
Higher earnings helped some issues .
Amgen rose 2 1\/4 to 54 3\/4 on almost 800,000 shares , and CVB Financial jumped 4 to 41 on only 1,000 shares .
Why ca n't we teach our children to read , write and reckon ?
It 's not that we do n't know how to , because we do .
It 's that we do n't want to .
And the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular , as well as to violate some cherished vested interests .
These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .
Here is an example .
If I were to ask a sample of American parents , `` Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course . ''
But what do we mean , specifically , by `` creativity '' ?
No one can say .
In practice , it ends up being equated with a `` self-expression '' that encourages the youngsters ' `` self-esteem . ''
The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
The whole notion of `` creativity '' in education was -LRB- and is -RRB- part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which was -LRB- and is -RRB- regarded as `` authoritarian , '' a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children .
It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive .
Fortunately , these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood , and they have enough common sense to know what that demands .
Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy .
American education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share .
The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way .
The reasons are complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated .
`` Progressive education '' -LRB- as it was once called -RRB- is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction .
It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in `` personality development '' and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results .
It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
I myself took such courses in college , thinking I might end up a schoolteacher .
They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses .
But it is unfair to dump on teachers , as distinct from the educational establishment .
I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .
They may not be among the `` best and brightest '' of their generation -- there are very few such people , by definition .
But they need not be to do their jobs well .
Yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days .
But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious .
In this sense , a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor .
If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place .
If he is competent and conscientious , he serves us well .
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis .
Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity ; it is not an educational problem .
It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
It is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading , for their own narrow purposes .
It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency .
But there is not one shred of evidence that , other things being equal , salary differentials result in educational differentials .
If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
If we wish to be serious about American education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do .
There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message .
Conversely , there are the majority of unsuccessful schools , and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand .
We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking .
In this respect , it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute , rather than eloquently `` concerned . ''
They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them .
Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that `` this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five . ''
A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need .
What Gov. Clinton is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years .
Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program .
We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference is quickly washed away .
Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea .
Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children .
Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school .
They should see to it that their kids do n't play truant ; they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing homework ; they should scrutinize the report card .
If parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another .
-- `` Community involvement '' is an even worse idea .
Here , the experience of New York City is decisive .
Locally elected school boards , especially in our larger cities , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians .
New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it .
-- In most states , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better .
The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons .
The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers .
There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures -LRB- in real terms -RRB- have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined .
That is the way the system works .
-- Students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows .
No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago .
This means `` tracking , '' whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish -LRB- though that is clearly desirable -RRB- than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work .
The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic '' is absurd .
The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential .
No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential .
-- It is generally desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them , alas , out of print -- rather than newer ones .
The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial .
They are based on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience .
One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods .
Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who ca n't add or subtract `` learning '' the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by Caleb Nelson -LRB- himself a recent math major at Harvard -RRB- in the November American Spectator .
-- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline .
Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head .
With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability .
Schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance .
This is a fact -- though , in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact , it is not surprising that one hears so little about it .
Mr. Kristol , an American Enterprise Institute fellow , co-edits The Public Interest and publishes The National Interest .
International Business Machines Corp. unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when computerizing their operations : Most machines ca n't talk to each other .
The company unveiled more than 50 products , mostly software , that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation -- the plant floor , design operations and production planning .
The aim , ultimately , is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning , marketing and other operations .
Manufacturers have already spent so heavily on automation that they are one of the computer industry 's leading revenue sources .
But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines , including robots and machine tools .
IBM 's announcement , which was expected and will formally be made to customers today , also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor , where Digital Equipment Corp. has long dominated and where Hewlett-Packard Co. has recently gained market share .
Consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the IBM strategy to fall into place , even though the specific products IBM unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter .
Sam Albert , a consultant in Scarsdale , N.Y. , said that in the past IBM has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines .
He said he believes IBM 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology .
He said he expects IBM to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months .
IBM 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing .
Rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers ' doors , IBM is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs .
IBM 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that IBM has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems .
IBM can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing , but it could also help customers on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents .
`` We may not have every manufacturing problem , but we have most , '' said George Conrades , IBM 's top marketing official .
Japan 's Big Four securities firms posted first-half unconsolidated results that mirrored softer performance as a result of slower turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during July and August .
Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms -- Nomura Securities Co. , Daiwa Securities Co. , Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities -- also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year ending March 31 , replacing the 12-month term formerly finishing Sept. 30 .
As a result , brokerage house officials said , appropriate comparisons from the same period a year earlier were unavailable .
Operating profit , pretax profit and net income results , however , were provided for the immediately preceding six-month period .
The statistics follow a year-on-year rebound in consolidated and unconsolidated results in the full fiscal year ended in March 1989 , recovering from dismal results in the prior fiscal year as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash .
Nomura said its pretax profits inched up 0.9 % to 248.91 billion yen -LRB- US$ 1.75 billion -RRB- from 246.60 billion yen in the six months ended March 31 .
Total operating profit fell 3.1 % to 486.1 billion yen from 501.61 billion yen .
Net income , however , rose 3.7 % to 107.87 billion yen from 103.98 billion yen .
Per-share net rose to 55.10 yen from 54.51 yen .
Daiwa said its pretax profits surged 9.6 % to 171.04 billion yen from 156.12 billion yen in the preceding six-month term .
Operating profit rose 5.5 % to 332.38 billion yen from 315.12 billion yen .
Net income jumped 21 % to 79.03 billion yen from 65.53 billion yen .
Per-share net rose to 62.04 yen from 51.50 yen .
Yamaichi said its pretax profit increased 8.9 % to 117.94 billion yen from 108.28 billion yen .
Operating profit rose 5.3 % to 279.75 billion yen from 265.79 billion yen .
Net income surged 21 % to 55.59 billion yen from 46.02 billion yen .
Per-share net rose to 47.46 yen from 39.31 yen .
Nikko 's pretax profit rose 1.6 % to 130.25 billion yen from 128.19 billion yen .
Operating profit rose 4 % to 293.29 billion yen from 282.08 billion yen .
Net income rose 23 % to 63.52 billion yen from 51.65 billion yen .
Per-share net rose to 44.08 yen from 36.13 yen .
Harken Energy Corp. of Dallas said it will drop its $ 11.75-a-share , or $ 190 million , offer for Tesoro Petroleum Corp. if the two companies do n't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15 .
Harken , which made its offer in August , said it still is awaiting a response to its offer from Tesoro 's board .
Harken also said that its financing from Bankers Trust Co. has been extended until Dec. 15 to give Tesoro 's board time to consider the offer at a Tesoro board meeting scheduled for mid-November .
Harken , which owns about 800 retail gas stations , has said it is particularly interested in Tesoro 's refinery because it would fill a gap in its business .
However , Tesoro , based in Houston , already has rejected a suitor in the past year .
Francis D. John , 35-year-old president , will assume the additional job of chief executive officer .
He succeeds Paul J. Montle , 42 , who will remain chairman .
National Environmental also said it will move its headquarters from Hingham to Folcroft , Pa. , the site of its sludge dewatering facility .
National Environmental , formerly Yankee Cos. , is a sludge treatment company .
Eagle Clothes Inc. , which is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , said it reached an agreement with its creditors .
Under the accord , Albert Roth , chairman and chief executive officer , and Arthur Chase , Sam Beigel , and Louis Polsky will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer .
Mr. Roth , who has been on leave from his posts , will be succeeded by Geoffrie D. Lurie of GDL Management Inc. , which is Eagle 's crisis manager .
Mr. Lurie is currently co-chief executive .
Arnold Levine , acting co-chief executive , will continue as senior vice president and a board member .
Eagle also said it received a commitment for as much as $ 8 million in financing from Norfolk Capital Group Inc .
In addition , a Norfolk affiliate , York Capital Inc. , will purchase all of the interests of Eagle 's secured lenders , which total $ 11.5 million , and guarantee as much as $ 8.2 million in payments to Eagle 's unsecured creditors .
A committee representing the unsecured creditors agreed to accept 24 cents on the dollar , Eagle said .
The plan would extend the period under which Eagle has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan .
It would extinguish all of Eagle 's existing capital stock and issue new stock to York as sole holder .
A bankruptcy court hearing is set for Nov. 3 on these accords .
In its bankruptcy-law petition , filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , Eagle said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender , Bankers Trust Co. , reduced its credit line .
In September 1988 , Eagle acquired Biny Clothing Inc. , a closely held New York chain operated under the Bonds name .
Eagle 's management retired and Biny 's management took control of the company .
At the time , Eagle reached a new credit agreement with Bankers Trust and with Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York for $ 8 million , and a new subordinated debt accord with First Century Partners and Biny management for $ 2 million .
But Eagle said the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged .
Under Chapter 11 , a company operates under protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debts .
Standard & Poor 's Corp. said it would add John H. Harland Co. , an Atlanta check printer , to its 500-stock index , effective at the close of trading on Wednesday .
American Medical International Inc. , a New York hospital operator , will be deleted from the index at that time .
American Medical is being acquired .
The tougher new regulations under the savings-and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act .
Largely to meet tougher new capital requirements , thrifts reduced their assets $ 13.4 billion in August , by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans .
Industry assets as of Aug. 31 were $ 1.31 trillion , the lowest since August 1988 .
As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in August , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits .
As interest rates paid depositors were lowered , thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 5.1 billion , not including interest credited to accounts .
It was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets , the Office of Thrift Supervision said .
The asset shrinkage was particularly concentrated in several large California institutions .
`` The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant in Alexandria , Va .
`` This suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon . ''
James Barth , an economist with the Office of Thrift Supervision , also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors .
`` August is a month when people are paying school tuition , '' he said .
`` That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry . ''
Not including thrifts under government conservatorship , S&Ls reduced their assets by $ 10.1 billion from the previous month , and deposit outflows totaled $ 3.9 billion .
For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion .
Thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities , which were reduced by $ 7.8 billion in August from the prior month .
As of Aug. 31 , thrifts held $ 185 billion in mortgage-backed securities .
The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $ 54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year .
Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink .
`` I think we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue , unless we see big changes in rates , '' Mr. Ely said .
For the first eight months of 1989 , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 44.5 billion .
For the prior year , deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ 8.8 billion .
The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth .
Since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the Department of Labor , underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics .
If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP .
It would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System , and the informed public generally , as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability .
In the early 1980s , I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade .
This forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces -- such as demographic changes , the oil shock and accelerating inflation -- that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s .
There has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981 .
But I had expected more , which is one reason I began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates .
The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period , but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated .
-LRB- It is , however , possible , that further study will reveal increasing bias . -RRB-
This bias is in no way deliberate .
The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data .
The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates -LRB- mainly employment or hours -RRB- instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data .
This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor .
In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s .
Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector , this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year , on average .
The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well .
Independent estimates of output in those industries , including one by the Department of Labor for banking , suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5 % a year between 1948 and 1988 .
Because finance and services contribute 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year .
The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes .
I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product .
Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services .
In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed .
Since then , further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least 0.26 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate .
In sum , the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP .
For the private domestic business economy , the bias was a bit over 0.5 percentage point .
In other words , the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about 20 % .

Union Carbide Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 35 % from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business .
Net was $ 139 million , or 98 cents a share , for the quarter , compared with $ 213 million , or $ 1.56 a share , a year ago .
Sales were $ 2.14 billion , up 1.6 % from $ 2.11 billion the previous year .
Carbide , like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry , was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter .
But the company 's latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on Wall Street .
`` It certainly was n't a disaster , but it does show weakness '' in some of the company 's chief markets , said George Krug , a chemicals-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Carbide closed at $ 24.50 a share , down 50 cents .
Prices for polyethylene , a common plastic and an important Carbide product , started to fall early this year ; the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories .
Prices also fell for ethylene oxide and glycols , products used in making antifreeze .
Some producers of polyethylene , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts .
The first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks , when the new prices become effective .
A Carbide spokesman said `` the conditions are right for the increase to hold . ''
For the third quarter , operating profit from Carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense .
Operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million .
In the industrial-gases segment , operating profit climbed to $ 87 million from $ 58 million .
The latest quarter included a gain of about $ 62 million on the sale of the company 's urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses .
Propylene glycols are used in making personal-care products such as shampoo , and urethane polyols are used in making the polyurethane foam found in furniture cushioning and other products .
That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business .
Polysilicon is used in making integrated circuits .
For the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74 a share , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71 a share , a year ago .
Sales rose 7.7 % to $ 6.66 billion from $ 6.19 billion .
At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders .
The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month , say several people familiar with the discussions .
Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico .
Just yesterday , New Hampshire announced it made a $ 75,000 settlement with Drexel , a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state .
These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon .
But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including New Jersey , New York , California , Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Missouri .
Officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel .
They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked .
Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties .
These stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street .
Ohio , the District of Columbia , Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions .
Drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , its securities business would n't be directly hurt .
It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking .
Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved .
Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the states .
But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public .
`` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel .
The question , she said , is whether Drexel should be allowed to pay and move on , or `` whether you should -LRB- simply -RRB- revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony . ''
While Ms. Bryant 's state went ahead and accepted Drexel 's settlement offer of $ 25,000 , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions .
I can see both sides . ''
Similarly , Alfred Rubega , New Hampshire 's director of securities regulation , said his state had n't received any complaints about Drexel , so it really could n't press the issue .
Still , `` I understand the reasons '' that other states are holding out , he said .
Mr. Cohen , the Drexel general counsel , said , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be losing any licenses . ''
Asked about states that are taking a hard line , he said , `` There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . ''
Mr. Cohen said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million .
By the end of this week , Drexel should have another three to four settlements , Mr. Cohen said .
`` The rate we 're going , I think that by the end of the month , we 're looking to have a total of 30 to 35 , '' he said .
That total would be important for Drexel .
The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry .
A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday .
There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling .
Drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of Drexel 's business in the state .
New Jersey , for example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused .
The state is n't ruling out revoking Drexel 's brokerage license .
The state can also bar Drexel as an investment adviser .
State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but James McLelland Smith , state securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed -LRB- Drexel -RRB- that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . ''
Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license .
It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters .
`` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said .
A banking department spokesman added : `` Commissioner Brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . ''
Particularly touchy are the cases of New York , which is Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties .
Neither state has settled , and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so .
But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials .
Ms. Bryant , the head of the state securities group , said Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago .
Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing .
`` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. Bryant said .
`` We need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again . ''
These are the 26 states , including the commonwealth of Puerto Rico , that have settled with Drexel : Alaska , Arkansas , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Mississippi , New Hampshire , New Mexico , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , South Carolina , South Dakota , Utah , Vermont , Washington , Wyoming and Puerto Rico .
Time Warner Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 176 million , or $ 2.88 cents a share , reflecting acquisition costs for a 59.3 % stake in Warner Communications Inc. and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction .
Separately , Warner reported a net loss of $ 106 million , or 56 cents a share , including merger expenses of $ 100 million and $ 120 million in charges associated with stock-appreciation-based compensation plans .
Time Warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining Warner shares .
Time Warner emphasized in a news release that it should be evaluated based on its cash flow , which the company defined as earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization .
On a pro-forma basis , assuming the merger was effective Jan 1 , 1988 , including the results from both Time Inc. and all of Warner , that cash flow figure would be $ 526 million for the latest quarter , more than double the comparable figure a year ago , or $ 242 million , according to Time Warner .
Some analysts at least are buying that argument , and were n't alarmed by the losses .
`` What really matters is the operating income of the divisions : I look at these numbers and I say , these businesses are doing well , '' said Mark Manson , a vice president of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
`` For example , Warner made more than $ 100 million from filmed entertainment in three months .
That 's a big number .
Warner also had a gain of more than 13 % from records and music publishing , even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer . ''
In the year-ago third quarter , Time on its own reported net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1.42 a share .
Combined revenue for the latest quarter of Time Warner was $ 2.2 billion , compared with the year-ago Time revenue of $ 1.1 billion .
On a pro forma basis , including all of Warner 's earnings , Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $ 217 million , compared with a $ 342 million loss a year earlier .
On the same basis , revenue rose to $ 2.7 billion from $ 2.2 billion .
For the third quarter , Warner 's $ 106 million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $ 113 million , or 90 cents a share .
Revenue rose to $ 1.5 billion from $ 1.1 billion .
The 1988 figures were restated to include the results of Lorimar Telepictures Corp. , which Warner acquired in January .
Time Warner 's operating earnings got a boost from Warner 's record box-office results .
`` Batman '' alone has racked up more than $ 247 million in box-office receipts to date , making it Warner Bros . ' largest grossing film ever .
`` Lethal Weapon II '' was also a big hit .
Warner also contributed record results from its music business , where unit sales of compact discs rose more than 50 % from a year ago , the company said , helped by Prince 's `` Batman '' soundtrack .
Time Warner said its cable division turned in a 77 % increase in operating cash flow , to $ 166 million from $ 94 million , reflecting higher per-subscriber revenue .
In addition , the 1988 results included a $ 20 million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at American Television & Communications Corp .
On the other hand , Time Warner said its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division , its books division and the Home Box Office programming division .
In magazines , higher advertising revenues at Sports Illustrated and Fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines .
The programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $ 12 million dividend from Turner Broadcasting System and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the Nov. 15 launch of HBO 's Comedy Channel .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Time Warner closed at $ 138.625 a share , up $ 1.875 , while Warner closed at $ 63.875 a share , up 12.5 cents .
Robert J. Penn , president and chief executive officer , will take early retirement from this steelmaker Dec 31 .
William S. Leavitt , chairman , said Mr. Penn , 58 years old , would continue as a consultant and would work with the board in selecting a successor .
UNR recently emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings that left 64 % of the reorganized company 's common stock in the hands of trustees of an asbestos-disease claims trust .
The company said it would have no further comment .
Mr. Leavitt , 37 , was elected chairman earlier this year by the company 's new board , having served as vice president for legal and corporate affairs .
His father , David S. Leavitt , was chairman and chief executive until his death in an accident five years ago , at which time Mr. Penn was named president .
Some House Democrats are trying to head off an appointment by President Bush to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan bailout , contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself .
Four Democrats on the House Banking Committee sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of James Simmons , an Arizona banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. Bush , to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp .
The Oversight Board , created in the savings-and-loan law signed in August , sets policy for the RTC , which will sell hundreds of the nation 's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets .
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp are members of the board .
President Bush must appoint two other members , one a Democrat and one a Republican .
An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons , the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way .
The Democratic appointee has n't been determined , the official said .
Mr. Simmons declined to comment , and the White House said the congressmen 's letter is under review .
The letter , dated last Thursday , cited the losses at Valley National , and at United Bank , also of Phoenix , where Mr. Simmons was chairman for 29 years .
Both banks have been battered , as have other Arizona banks , by falling real estate prices .
Valley National , for example , had $ 470 million in problem assets as of June .
`` We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key RTC appointment , '' the letter said .
`` The RTC needs the most able , competent management available . ''
But Mr. Simmons has long ties to both Republicans and banking .
He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush 's Arizona campaign committee in last year 's election , and also worked for Mr. Bush in the 1980 election .
The two met more than 30 years ago , when Mr. Simmons worked for Commercial Bank & Trust Co. of Midland , Texas , where Mr. Bush was an organizing director .
In 1986 , Mr. Simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed by William Seidman , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp .
That committee determined to open Arizona to banking across state lines .
Arizona Trend magazine referred to Mr. Simmons this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state .
The letter to Mr. Bush was signed by Reps. Bruce Vento -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , the chairman of the Banking Committee 's RTC Task Force , Thomas McMillen -LRB- D. , Md. -RRB- , Kweisi Mfume -LRB- D. , Md . -RRB- and Paul Kanjorski -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- .
Randolph W. McElroy , a vice chairman of this bank-holding company , was named to the additional position of chairman of its principal unit , Sovran Bank .
Mr. McElroy , 54 years old , will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit .
Sovran also named John B. Werner a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of Sovran Financial , increasing the number of corporate board members to 35 .
Mr. Werner , 58 , was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit .
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company .
The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance .
Moody 's also said it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank , now known as Bank One , Texas N.A. , reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC .
Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes .
At Lloyd 's of London , underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper .
Visitors are ushered into the premises by red-frocked doormen known as waiters , a reminder of the insurance market 's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century London .
Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present .
Lloyd 's , once a pillar of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation .
The 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters , the most recent of which is last week 's earthquake in California 's Bay Area .
At the same time , Lloyd 's is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business .
The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow , less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors .
`` Lloyd 's is on the ropes , '' says Peter Nutting , a Lloyd 's investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence .
`` It needs more discipline .
It needs to sort itself out . ''
Most troublesome is the shrinking pool of `` names , '' the well-heeled investors -LRB- some of them royal -RRB- who , as members of about 360 syndicates , underwrite policies .
Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year , more than triple the number of resignations in 1987 .
Names are resigning at an even faster pace this year .
Lackluster returns are one reason .
The average after-tax return on investment in 1986 , the most recent year for which results are available , was 6.5 % , according to Chatset Ltd. , an insurance consulting firm in London .
In 1985 , it was 2.1 % .
Between 1981 and 1986 , the most recent five-year period for which figures are available , Lloyd 's reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses -LRB- $ 5.7 billion at today 's exchange rates -RRB- , more than double the # 1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period .
Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability .
Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims , but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
And catastrophes are getting ever more costly .
Lloyd 's claims for the 1988 Piper Alpha oil-rig disaster in the North Sea , for instance , may reach $ 1 billion .
During the five-year period ended 1986 , roughly 80 % of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates , according to Chatset consultants .
The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now .
`` I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that 's how bad it is , '' Betty Atkins , a secretary from suburban London , says .
Ms. Atkins , whose Lloyd 's membership was a bonus from a former employer in 1981 , belongs to Mr. Nutting 's dissident group on the Outhwaite syndicate , which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims .
Ms. Atkins , who underwrote # 20,000 , or about $ 32,000 , of insurance coverage on that syndicate , now faces potential losses of roughly # 70,000 , or $ 111,000 .
`` If Lloyd 's wants # 70,000 out of me they will have to take everything I 've got -- and even then I do n't know if it will be enough , '' she says .
Unease is widespread among exchange members .
`` I ca n't think of any reason to join Lloyd 's now , '' says Keith Whitten , a British businessman and a Lloyd 's member since 1979 .
`` The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ''
If profits do n't improve , Mr. Whitten says he may quit the exchange .
Meanwhile , competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying .
Lloyd 's is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance .
Over the past decade , competitors have chipped away at the exchange 's share of the # 2.5 billion marine market in London , where half the world 's ships are insured .
Lloyd 's 66 % stake in that market has shrunk to 50 % in that period , according to an official at the Institute of London Underwriters , a Lloyd 's competitor .
-LRB- The official asked not to be named . -RRB-
Much of the business has gone to the institute , an association of more than 100 insurers , including Cigna Corp. , Allianz Versicherungs AG of West Germany and Britain 's Commercial Union Assurance PLC .
Lloyd 's has endured decades of genteel decline .
At the peak of its power and influence a century ago , Lloyd 's dominated the insurance world with a 50 % stake .
It virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe .
Today , Lloyd 's share of the world market , excluding life insurance , is about 2 % .
-LRB- Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . -RRB-
Bigger rivals , such as Aetna and Allianz , backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates , brokers say .
Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now-standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business .
Beyond that , many big oil , chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry-specific coverage .
Even Lloyd 's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged .
Only 10 years ago , for instance , Lloyd 's was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses .
But since 1981 , Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington , Ky. has grabbed a 20 % stake of the market .
Ronald Kirk , president , says Lloyd 's has suffered because its structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients ; brokers are required intermediaries .
Thus , he asserts , Lloyd 's ca n't react quickly to competition .
`` Lloyd 's has lost control of the situation , '' he says .
`` They are n't controlling their destiny like they used to . ''
Murray Lawrence , Lloyd 's chairman , agrees the exchange faces big challenges .
`` This is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead , '' he says .
`` We have been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take , copy and cut rates . ''
Lloyd 's , he says , is cut off from `` the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence '' against catastrophic losses .
By that , he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance .
The exchange , he says , must find new products and new markets .
That wo n't be an easy task .
Tradition is dictator at Lloyd 's .
Three years ago , the exchange took up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that Britain 's Prince Charles has denounced .
-LRB- Some exchange wags call the building `` the oil rig . '' -RRB-
But along with such treasured artifacts as Lord Nelson 's spyglass , Lloyd 's also brought its outmoded ways of doing business .
The Lloyd 's market actively underwrites insurance just 4 1\/2 hours a day , brokers say .
Underwriting does n't get under way until after morning tea at 10 a.m .
A two-hour lunch break follows .
Things wind down at about 4:30 p.m. , just in time for afternoon tea .
Lloyd 's vast trading hall houses a warren of well-polished desks .
The hall 's few computers are used mostly to send messages .
Sandwiched between desks , underwriters sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies .
Brokers clutching thick folders stand in lines , waiting their turn to speak to the underwriters .
A broker may have to approach as many as 20 underwriters who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates .
It could take six months for a claim to be paid .
`` The system , '' says Nicholas Samengo-Turner , a Lloyd 's broker who left the exchange in 1985 , `` is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad . ''
Some maintain underwriters also have been inept .
John Wetherell , a Lloyd 's underwriter , says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50 % the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985 .
`` How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation , '' he says .
Lloyd 's officials decline to comment on the matter .
More recently , property rates have increased .
Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further .
But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters .
The magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims .
Lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for 1986 .
That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .
But Mr. Lawrence says reported profit will be down in 1987 , 1988 and 1989 , though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be .
Insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $ 600 million in aviation losses -LRB- including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie , Scotland -RRB- and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September 's Hurricane Hugo .
Lloyd 's says the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity , currently about # 11 billion .
Mr. Lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names .
Meanwhile , the exchange has been trying to lower costs .
-LRB- It recently cut its work force by 9 % , or 213 . -RRB-
But Lloyd 's is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology .
Mr. Wetherell , the underwriter , reckons half of his business could be transacted by computer , cutting costs at least 10 % .
Though Lloyd 's has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions , the effort has n't gotten very far .
Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information .
Both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings , even for routine policies .
Lloyd 's overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies .
Some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low-margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers .
Lloyd 's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada .
But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters , brokers and administrators before being implemented .
The proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand .
Lloyd 's is moving forward on some fronts , though .
Mr. Lawrence says the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims .
By next year , all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims .
Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co. named Masahiro Dozen president .
Mr. Dozen succeeds Sadakane Doi , who will become vice chairman .
Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa , Japan 's second-largest securities firm .
In Japanese firms , the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations , while the chairman 's role is more a ceremonial one .
The title of chief executive officer is n't used .
While people within Daiwa , particularly internationalists , expected that Mr. Dozen , 52 , would eventually become Daiwa 's president , the speed of his promotion surprised many .
It was only earlier this year that the jovial , easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president .
Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing .
Daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms .
As of March 31 , the Daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801.21 billion yen -LRB- $ 5.64 billion -RRB- .
For the six months ended Sept. 30 , Daiwa reported unconsolidated -LRB- parent company -RRB- net income of 79.03 billion yen -LRB- $ 556.5 million -RRB- on revenue of 332.38 billion yen -LRB- $ 2.34 billion -RRB- .
Both figures were record highs .
Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen 's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan 's domestic markets , which should mean increased competition .
All of Japan 's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. , the world 's largest , Nikko Securities Co. Ltd. , Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. and Daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets .
While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the U.S. .
American institutional investors have never had a large appetite for Japanese equities .
And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months , they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors .
At the same time , Daiwa and its brethren have faced stiff competition from well-entrenched American competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to U.S. corporations and institutional investors .
Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand .
When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors .
`` He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said Koji Yoneyama , president of Daiwa 's U.S. unit .
`` But not a single piece of paper was sold . ''
By his own account , Mr. Dozen did n't do much better with U.S. bonds .
In an interview a few months ago , he recalled how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc. , he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues .
But he could n't sell any .
`` Japanese stock salesmen selling American bonds ?
Maybe it 's crazy , '' he said .
Mr. Dozen even related the indignity suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing expedition off the New Jersey shore and caught nothing .
Upon returning to New York , `` Exhausted , I got into a taxicab , and the woman driver said : ` Americans make better fishermen , ' '' he recalled .
Undaunted , Mr. Dozen said that Daiwa 's goal is to build `` a high-technology oriented international organization with maybe some Japanese flavor to it . ''
He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions .
Mr. Dozen said Daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base , its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors .
Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959 .
Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms , he began his career peddling stock to individual investors .
In his climb to the top , Mr. Dozen also headed the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income units and its international operations .
`` He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience ; he is very well-balanced , '' said Takuro Isoda , chairman of Daiwa 's U.S. unit in New York .
But it Mr. Dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales force -- to accede to the presidency .
Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies ' earnings .
And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force `` would be fragile , '' said a Daiwa executive .
If Mr. Dozen has a weakness , it may be his golf game .
`` He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball , like a farmer , '' said Mr. Yoneyama .
Inco Ltd. posted a 35 % decline in third-quarter net income , a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations .
The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8 % of its common outstanding .
Inco shares fell after the announcements .
Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend .
Inco closed at $ 31.125 a share , down 62.5 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Some analysts said Inco , which had cash reserves of $ 272 million as of Sept. 30 , could still announce a special dividend in the next few months , though it would be smaller than the $ 10-a-share special dividend it paid last year .
The quarterly dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 3 .
Inco 's net fell to $ 129.3 million , or $ 1.23 a share , in the third quarter from $ 200.3 million , or $ 1.88 a share , a year earlier .
Sales rose 8.2 % to $ 848.7 million from $ 784.5 million .
Excluding special gains from tax-loss carry-forwards , earnings in the latest quarter were $ 117.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share , compared with $ 187.4 million , or $ 1.76 a share .
Inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company 's Manitoba operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore .
Inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next 12 months if nickel market conditions are favorable .
Under a previous buyback program , Inco has purchased 1.7 million of its shares since April .
UAL Corp. 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying United Airlines ' parent should remain independent for now .
As a result , UAL 's chairman , Stephen M. Wolf , pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company .
The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility .
The effort to create the nation 's largest employee-owned company began unraveling Oct. 13 when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion offer .
Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC , the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support .
Takeover stock traders , focusing on the company 's intention to stay independent , took the announcement as bad news .
UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement .
Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co. , which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 .
The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal .
Twelve of UAL 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid .
But the board said it was n't interested for now .
That proposal , valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share , would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands .
The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan .
And , with no other offers on the table , the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it .
The directors signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . ''
But it was clear that for the time being , the board wants the company to return to normalcy .
The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public ... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong , viable , independent company . ''
Mr. Wolf urged all employees to `` now turn their full attention '' to operating the airline .
He also vowed to `` make every effort to nurture ... a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups . ''
But Mr. Wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again .
Labor problems top the list .
For a brief time , the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United 's pilot union .
In return for an ownership stake in the company , the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted .
That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out .
As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft .
It 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement .
The union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort `` still need to be addressed . ''
The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United 's pilot and machinist unions .
The machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction .
The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf , but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union .
The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out .
They paid $ 15 million for a 1 % stake and received an additional 9 % of the company at no additional cost .
His credibility is also on the line in the investment community .
Until the collapse of this bid , Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines .
But he and his chief financial officer , John Pope , sowed some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options .
The board 's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ 700 million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer .
It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits .
Arbitragers said they were disappointed the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value .
One takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote .
The machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees .
Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , whose $ 240-a-share offer for UAL in August triggered a bidding war , says he remains interested in the airline .
However , he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential UAL data .
Essentially , he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ 300 a share .
Tandy Corp. said it wo n't join U.S. Memories , the group that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips .
Tandy 's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories .
Last month , Apple Computer Inc. said that it would n't invest in the group .
Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development .
U.S. Memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ 10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips , a market dominated by the Japanese .
Those chips were in dire shortage last year , hurting many U.S. computer companies that could n't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips .
Tandy said its experience during the shortage did n't merit the $ 5 million to $ 50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor .
`` At this time , we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need -LCB- for DRAMs -RCB- from the market as a rule , '' said Ed Juge , Tandy 's director of market planning .
Sanford Kane , U.S. Memories president , said the decision was `` disappointing , '' but does n't presage U.S. Memories ' failure .
`` I would like to have had them , '' he said .
But `` they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it . ''
Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June , when the group was formed by seven electronics companies : Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. ; Hewlett-Packard Co. ; Intel Corp. ; International Business Machines Corp. ; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp .
Mr. Kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan , probably late this week .
U.S. Memories needs a catalyst , he said , to inspire others to join .
But so far , most potential participants have n't decided .
Sun Microsystems Inc. said it 's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it was waiting to see U.S. Memories ' business plan .
Personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. said it is still studying the situation .
A Compaq Computer Corp. spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet , although `` it is n't under active consideration .
In a startling turnabout , Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them .
David Boren , the Intelligence Committee chairman , is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination .
With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the leakers are performing a public service .
If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega , the American people ought to know .
What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry .
Naturally , Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping `` top secret '' on their own complicity .
But there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue .
And if Congress is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy , it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too .
The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega .
When they did , his commanders did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads .
The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity .
But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by Congress ?
For example , what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations ?
What part did U.S. warnings play in the major 's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody , but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops ?
Mr. Noriega did n't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol .
Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning : You have the right to conceal your coup intentions , because we may rat on you .
Or maybe a Surgeon General 's warning : Confiding in the United States may be fatal .
CIA chief William Webster , hardly a Washington malcontent , got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup .
The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point .
`` The interpretation '' of the executive order , Mr. Stoltz said , `` and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it , has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators , including me . ''
In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA .
The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter .
And of course , doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties .
Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North .
The Intelligence Committee 's ranking Republican , Senator William Cohen , joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra , deploring `` Men of Zeal . ''
No doubt many people in the CIA , the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it .
What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail ?
Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play ?
The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action .
President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America 's national security .
There are of course good reasons the U.S. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars .
The world being the nasty place it is , we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed .
In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility .
The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral .
As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi .
It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal .
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him .
We 've heard California 's property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years , but ABC 's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance .
Mr. Katz happily agreed , sliding over the fact that California 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes .
Both have been raised at least 30 % in recent years , even while the price of gasoline has fallen .
Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch .
A series of explosions tore through the huge Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near here , injuring more than a hundred and closing parts of the Houston Ship Channel .
There were no immediate reports of deaths , but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night .
The Bartlesville , Okla. , oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires , which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air .
One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant 's reactors .
Glenn Cox , Phillips ' president and chief operating officer , and other Phillips officials flew from Bartlesville to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Phillips Petroleum shares fell $ 1.125 to $ 23.125 .
The plastics plant is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the U.S. Gulf Coast .
The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel , where about 150 companies have operations , because the thick , black smoke obscured the area .
The Port of Houston closed its terminal for handling bulk cargo .
Broken water lines and gas leaks hindered firefighters ' efforts , but by late yesterday authorities said they had the fire under control .
The blasts blew out windows , spewed debris for miles and crumpled the ceiling in an area elementary school .
The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston , about 10 miles away .
Nearby Pasadena , Texas , police reported that 104 people had been taken to area hospitals , but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise .
The injured , including three in critical condition , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said .
The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts .
The number working at the time of the blast was n't known .
Yesterday 's explosions were the second round in two months at the plastics plant .
In late August , four contract workers were injured and one Phillips employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility 's boiler house .
The Phillips facility manufactures polyethylene , polypropylene and K-resin , plastics used in a wide array of applications , including milk jugs and toys .
Plastics are the cornerstone of Phillips ' chemicals operations , which is the biggest single contributor to the company 's profits .
A federal judge in Manhattan has entered a judgment requiring a Chicago organized crime figure to pay the government $ 250,000 , representing alleged profits he gained from his involvement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters .
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law .
Joseph Lombardo , who the government alleged was the `` captain '' of organized crime in Chicago , was one of numerous defendants in the government 's sweeping racketeering suit against the Teamsters .
In the suit , filed in June 1988 , the government accused the union 's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering .
Among other things , the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely handpicked the union 's top officials .
